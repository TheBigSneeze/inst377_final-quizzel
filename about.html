        <h1> About us</h1>
        <p> This is our creation for the final project of INST377.
            The idea was that this website would have quizzes that would help
            someone decide what they wanted to do. Fro example, what would they wanted 
            to eat or make for dinner? Or, What should they do for fun?
            please let us know that you liked it or not!
