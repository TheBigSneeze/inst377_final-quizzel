        <h1> About us</h1>
        <p> This is our creation for the final project of INST377.
            The idea was that this website would have quizzes that would help
            someone decide what they wanted to do. Like, what they wanted to eat
            or make for dinner
            please let us know that you liked it or not! It was made using 
            <a href="https://quizapi.io/" target="_blank">QuizAPI.io!</a>
